## Gunicorn Worker keep restarting when starting server (`WORKER TIMEOUT`)
```shell

```

Code decryption may increases application startup time, which may cause the worker to exceed the default timeout threshold (30 seconds), leading to `WORKER TIMEOUT` errors.

To resolve this, increase Gunicornâ€™s [--timeout](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html#timeout) setting to factor in the additional decryption time.
```shell
# Set timeout to 60 seconds via command line:
gunicorn --workers 4 --timeout 60 --worker-class gevent your_app:app  

# Or configure via a config file (gunicorn.py):  
timeout = 60  
worker_class = "gevent"  
```
